            <h2>A bit about her life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Born Frances Elizabeth Snyder in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1917.</li>
                <li>Studied journalism, because its curriculum let her travel far afield.</li>
                <li>During WW II, she was hired by the Moore School of Engineering to work as a "computer" and chosen to
                    be one of
                    the six women to program the ENIAC.</li>
                <li>After World War II, Holberton worked at Remington Rand and the National Bureau of Standards.</li>
                <li>She helped to develop the UNIVAC, designing control panels that put the numeric keypad next to the
                    keyboard and
                    persuading engineers to replace the Univac's black exterior with the gray-beige tone that came to be
                    the
                    universal color of computers.</li>
                <li>She was one of those who wrote the first generative programming system (SORT/MERGE).</li>
                <li>In 1953 she was made a supervisor of advanced programming in a part of the Navyâ€™s Applied Math lab
                    in Maryland,
                    where she stayed until 1966.</li>
                <li>Later, as an employee of the National Bureau of Standards, she was very active in the first two
                    revisions of the
                    Fortran language standard ("FORTRAN 77" and "Fortran 90").</li>
            </ul>
